# Avtaar_Assignment_1-
Simple project to generate a unique id for a given string.

This is simple java code which takes name entered by the user as parameter and generates unique id's for them and also tells the date and time of request.

Header files used- 
1.java.util.* - built-in package in Java which encapsulates a similar group of classes, sub-packages and interfaces.
2.java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter and java.time.LocalDateTime - used for parsing dates in different formats.

Methods used-
hashCode()-for generating unique id's
LocalDateTime.now()- fetching current date and time
nextLine()-reads next line entered by the user as input

I created this file on a simple notepad and used command prompt for its compilation and execution.
The image of the output and the java file are attached in the repository.
